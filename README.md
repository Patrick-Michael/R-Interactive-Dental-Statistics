# Digital Health Insights: Interactive Dental Statistics  

**A visualization-driven approach to optimize dental practice management using R and Shiny.**  
---


## Overview  

Monthly reports in dental practices often come as bulky, unstructured Excel files:  
- Merged cells, typos, and inconsistent formatting  
- Difficult to process with computers  
- Limited utility for decision-making  

This project cleans and transforms these reports into **interactive, user-friendly dashboards** using **R** and **Shiny**.  
It enables managers to quickly analyze performance, revenue, and workforce distribution — turning raw data into actionable insights.
